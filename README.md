# TurtleBot3 Gazebo Navigation Course

A ROS 2 course workspace for **object-based semantic navigation** on a
simulated TurtleBot3. The robot explores an unknown room on its own, builds a
SLAM map, recognises the objects it passes and remembers where they are — so
`go to chair` makes it stop exploring and drive to the real chair. Gazebo,
SLAM, Nav2, frontier exploration, semantic memory, command parsing and the
coordinator state machine are all provided and working; the course asks you to
write the object detector in `tb3_detector`. The system is designed *map first,
query later*: the robot builds a semantic map while it explores, and `go to X`
is a lookup in that map.

As shipped, that detector is a stub: `detector_core.py` publishes empty
detections and the rest of the pipeline waits for it. Implementing its `load()`
and `infer()` is the graded task. The assignment and acceptance criteria are in
**[INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)**; rationale and measured results are in
**[NOTES.md](NOTES.md)**.

## Repository layout

| Package (`src/`) | Role | You edit it? |
|---|---|---|
| `tb3_detector` | YOLO detection on the camera image (`tb3det_yolo26n`, fine-tuned; weights included) | **Yes — `detector_core.py` is the assignment** |
| `tb3_bringup` | every launch file, the RViz config, the Gazebo worlds, the vendored models and `semantic_targets.yaml` | No |
| `tb3_localizer` | bbox centre → bearing + LiDAR range → `(x, y)` in `base_link` | No (optional bonus, NOTES.md §9) |
| `tb3_memory` | short-term memory, stable IDs `person_0…` | No |
| `tb3_coordinator` | persistent map landmarks + the coordinator state machine | No |
| `tb3_query` | rule-based command parsing (`SemanticQueryResult` msg) | No |
| `tb3_nav_adapter` | approach-pose computation for Nav2 | No |
| `tb3_frontier_exploration` | frontier detection + goal assignment (C++) | No |

Outside `src/`: [`docker/`](docker/) is the image behind the macOS and Windows
setups, [`docs/`](docs/) the setup pages and demo media, [`scripts/`](scripts/)
the acceptance run.

## Setup by platform

| Platform | Start here | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Ubuntu 22.04** *(default — the validated setup)* | the steps just below | native ROS 2 Humble + Gazebo Classic 11 |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon or Intel) | [docs/setup-macos.md](docs/setup-macos.md) | a Docker container with this checkout mounted, Gazebo/RViz in a browser tab, then the steps below |
| **Windows 10/11** | [docs/setup-windows.md](docs/setup-windows.md) | WSL 2 + Ubuntu 22.04 running the same native stack, then the steps below (Docker is a documented fallback) |

You need Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Classic 11, 4+ CPU cores,
and `tmux` (for `scripts/acceptance_run.sh` only).

**1. apt packages**

```bash
sudo apt install \
  ros-humble-desktop \
  ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs \
  ros-humble-turtlebot3-gazebo \
  ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup \
  ros-humble-slam-toolbox \
  ros-humble-vision-msgs ros-humble-cv-bridge \
  ros-humble-tf2-geometry-msgs \
  ros-humble-rqt-image-view \
  python3-colcon-common-extensions \
  python3-pip \
  tmux
```

**2. pip packages.** Order and pins matter: `ultralytics` pulls in `torch` and
would fetch the ~2 GB CUDA build, so install the CPU build first; `numpy` stays
below 2.0 because Humble's `cv_bridge` is built against NumPy 1.x.

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install 'numpy==1.26.4' 'opencv-python==4.9.0.80' 'ultralytics==8.4.31'
```

**3. Detector weights** — nothing to do. `tb3det_yolo26n.pt` (5.4 MB) ships
with the repository and is picked up by the build.

**Clone the repository** into your home directory (the macOS and Windows pages
already do this — skip it if you came from one of them):

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YiyuchenHu/turtlebot3-gazebo-navigation-hw.git turtlebot3-gazebo-navigation-course
```

**4. Build.** If you have conda, run `conda deactivate` first.

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3-gazebo-navigation-course
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Keep `--symlink-install` on **every** build — dropping it later makes edits to
configs and launch files silently stop taking effect.

## Running

In **every** terminal, prepare the environment first:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3-gazebo-navigation-course
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
```

Then open the terminals **in order**, waiting for each ready signal before
starting the next:

| # | Command | What it starts | Ready when … |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `ros2 launch tb3_bringup sim.launch.py` | Gazebo (server + GUI) + TurtleBot3 spawn, vendored `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` | Console prints `Successfully spawned entity [waffle_pi]` and the Gazebo window shows the room + robot (~5 s; first-ever start can take longer) |
| T2 | `ros2 launch tb3_bringup nav.launch.py` | SLAM Toolbox + Nav2 + RViz | Console prints `[lifecycle_manager_navigation]: Managed nodes are active` (~5–10 s); RViz shows a first gray map patch |
| T3 | `ros2 launch tb3_bringup backend.launch.py` | Course backend: memory, semantic map memory, query, nav adapter, coordinator, warmup + frontier exploration | `CoordinatorNode ready — mode=EXPLORING` immediately; after a ±45° warm-up scan, `frontier exploration enabled` (~10 s) and the robot starts exploring |
| T4 | `ros2 launch tb3_bringup localizer.launch.py` | Localizer (bbox + LiDAR → object position) | `LocalizerNode ready` + `Image width learned: 640 px` (~1 s), then quiet until detections arrive |
| T5 | `ros2 launch tb3_bringup detector.launch.py` | Detector: YOLO inference on the camera image | `Model loaded. Classes: [...]` then `detector_node ready` (~3 s, first inference warms up torch); `ros2 topic echo /detector_node/detections` streams non-empty `detections` once an object is in view; RViz **Detector Debug Image** shows green boxes |
| T6 | *(no launch — the command console)* | Send user commands, watch status | — |

```bash
# T6
ros2 topic pub --once /user_command std_msgs/String "data: 'go to person 0'"
ros2 topic echo /coordinator_node/status
```

**Map first, query later.** Exploration takes 2–8 minutes, and only objects that
are already on the semantic map can be navigated to: `go to X` is a lookup in
that map, not a search for X. Commands are not queued — a reply of
`no active <target> in memory` means the robot has not seen that object yet;
wait until its marker appears in `/semantic_memory_markers` in RViz, then send
the command again. Later commands reuse the same map, so once a landmark is
there it stays reachable. You can restart any single terminal without touching
the others.
