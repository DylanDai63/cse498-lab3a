# `tb3_detector` — YOUR ASSIGNMENT PACKAGE

> **⚠️ YOUR TASK — `detector_core.py` ships as a stub publishing empty detections.** Implementing its `load()` and `infer()` is the graded task; everything else in this package is provided.

Stage 1: YOLO inference on `/camera/image_raw`, publishing `vision_msgs/Detection2DArray` on `/detector_node/detections` plus an annotated `/detector_node/debug_image`. Labels are raw COCO strings — the rest of the stack translates them via `tb3_bringup/config/semantic_targets.yaml`.

- **Node:** `detector_node` — Terminal 5, `ros2 launch tb3_bringup detector.launch.py`
- **Config:** [`config/detector.yaml`](config/detector.yaml) (`conf_threshold`, `class_filter` — detector labels, never semantic names). Weights: `models/tb3det_yolo26n.pt` ships with the repo (fine-tuned; see NOTES.md "How the detector was trained")
- **Docs:** assignment and acceptance criteria in [INSTRUCTIONS](../../INSTRUCTIONS.md); rationale in [NOTES](../../NOTES.md)
